qxargs
======

Call `xargs` quickly.

Well, the name may be over claimed because I did not implement all functionalities of `xargs`.

Installing
----------

MacOS is simple.

    $ brew install iwat/public/qxargs

Other OS needs to build from source, which is also one liner.

    $ go get github.com/iwat/qxargs

Usage
-----

This should be understandable.
